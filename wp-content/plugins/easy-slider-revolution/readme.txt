== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I insert 'Easy Slider' sliders into my WordPress pages or posts? =

When you are editing your slider within the WordPress Dashboard, you will see a box with the heading `Shortcode / Preview` on the right-hand side. Copy the slider shortcode and Paste this copied shortcode into the page or post where you would like your slider to appear. This is also the method to use if you want to insert your slider into a text widget or another custom content type, such as a portfolio post.

= How do I define slide background images? =

The `Slide Background` box for each slide in your slider allows you to define a background image for each slide. Note that the content you add to each slide within the slide editor box for each slide is foreground content and sits on `top` of the slide background - this content can be other images and textual content.

To set a slide background image, click the `Set Image` button. The `Background Size` setting determines if, and how the background image is stretched/shrunk to cover the slide content area and the `Background Repeat` setting determines if the backgroung image should be repeated, like tiles. 

The `Min Height` setting  is also available in top of the slider settings.
